// Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

let countries :string[]= ["Pakistan","England","New Zealand","Dubai","Turkey"];
for(let i=0;i<countries.length;i++){
    console.log(countries[i]);
};
