// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

let magicians: string[] = ["Harry Houdini", "David Blaine", "Penn Jillette", "Teller"];

function show_magicians(magicians: string[]) {
    magicians.forEach(magician=> console.log(magician));
    
}
function make_great(magicians: string[]) {
   return magicians.map(magician => `The Great ${ magician}`);
           
     };

let great_magicians = make_great(magicians);
console.log(great_magicians);
