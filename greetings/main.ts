//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let friendsName=["Adeena","Rameen","Hadia","Hafsa"];
for(let i=0;i<friendsName.length;i++){
    console.log("Hello "+friendsName[i]+" ,How are you? What are you doing");
}
